# Landing Page Service

We have some courses and other digital products we would like to create landing pages for that will collect the email addresses of people interested in each of these products.

We would like to collect the email addresses somewhere so we can send out emails to inform our prospective customers about the products they are interested in. It would be nice if the system would automatically send a response email thanking the prospective customer for registering. That would give the customer an immediate response rather than waiting for us to notice that a new customer registered and then sending them an email manually much later.

Since we will have several digital products the emails sent to the customer should be tailored to the product they are interested in. That way, we can customize the email sent out for a particular product.

It would be nice to have the ability to create an email template for a product that way we can personalize the email with their name or other information about the product.

We have seen other email marketing systems that can send out a series of emails spaced out with a couple of days in between. We would like to be able to schedule a series of emails for a product and specify the number of days in between each email and the next one.

Some of the emails may have links to PDFs or other downloadable links.

Once a customer purchases a product, they should no longer receive sales related emails and they should now be sent product related update emails.

We would like to track where an email addresses was submitted from so we can see which marketing campaigns were successful and which ones were not and at what point the customer converted. There could be several locations with the email input form and it is possible we will add this to blog articles or other places.

A customer should be able to unsubscribe from receiving emails. If customer registers again after unsubscribing we would like that email address to be reactivated from where they left off.
