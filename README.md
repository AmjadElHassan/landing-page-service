# How to Plan and Build a Project from Scratch

"I have an project idea I would like build, but I don't know where to start." I have seen this statment made many times and I often find that I say this to myself too. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer, "writer's block" is likely to occur without doing the very short and simple steps described here I use to get myself started.

What I have learned and have been doing for many years now is to create three very short and simple artifacts before I start buildng my projects. Whether these projects are smaller personal projects or large projects with a team of developers, I have learned that these three artifacts make developing projects so much easier and they remove the writer's block I usually experience if I don't do this.

The three artifacts are created in this order. A one-page description of the project in human terms. Anyone should be able to read this single page and know what the project will do. Next, a workflow diagram which is actually a combination sequence, class, and workflow diagram. Once the workflow diagram is done, a task list is created from the workflow diagram with tasks broken down into single day units of work. That's it. This process typlically takes a day or less depending on the size of the project.

The following describes these three artifacts in detail using a small project as an example.

## How to Write a One-Pager

A one-pager is typically single page or less that describes the project in human terms so anyone reading it will know what the project will do. I usually just start writing about the project, usually starting with the problem that needs to be solved, then go into the description of how this project solves that problem.

## How to Create a Workflow Diagram

Next, I create a workflow diagram from the one-pager description. This workflow diagram is a combination of a sequence diagram and a class diagram done in a workflow like form. This diagram does not use strict UML, just boxes and lines with arrows or diamonds, and a bunch on text in the whitespace to describe that part of the diagram. I often number the steps or show some form of entry point so the reader knows where to start from. The boxes are classes or screen mockups, the lines with arrows indicate the direction of flow while the lines with diamonds indicate class relationships. Once the task breakdown step is completed (below) the tasks identified are added to the workflow diagram to show what part of the system the task improves.

## How to Create a Task Breakdown

With the workflow diagram completed, I start from the entry point and created a task list to complete that one box or line on the diagram. This could be a single task it in can be completed in a day; otherwise, it ends up being a dscription of what needs to be accomplished and a list of subtasks are created in single day chunks until the task is completely tasked out. Then it is on to the next box or line in the work flow. Sometimes, there are multiple entry points so each of those are addressed in the same manner.
